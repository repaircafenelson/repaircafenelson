Welcome to the Nelson Repair Café, launching in 2025! We are a volunteer-driven initiative in Nelson, BC, focused on reducing waste, sharing knowledge, and fostering a sense of community through the power of repair.  

## What is a Repair Café?  

A Repair Café is a community space where people can bring broken or damaged items to be fixed for free with the help of skilled volunteers. It’s more than just a place to repair things—it’s a hub for sustainability, education, and connection.  

At the Nelson Repair Café, you can bring items such as:  
- **Small appliances** (e.g., toasters, blenders, lamps)  
- **Clothing and textiles** (e.g., torn pants, broken zippers, missing buttons)  
- **Bikes and small tools**  
- **Electronics** (basic repairs)  
- **Furniture or household items**

For more general information about the concept of Repair Cafes go [here](https://www.repaircafe.org/en/).

Our volunteers will work with you to troubleshoot and fix your items, empowering you with new skills and knowledge.  

## Why Repair?  

Every year, millions of items are discarded simply because they’re broken, even though many could be repaired. Repair Cafés help:  
- **Reduce waste**: By keeping items out of landfills.  
- **Save money**: Avoid the cost of replacement.  
- **Learn skills**: Gain hands-on experience in repairing your own belongings.  
- **Build community**: Connect with like-minded individuals who care about sustainability.  

## How It Works  

1. **Bring Your Item**: Drop in during our scheduled Repair Café events with your broken or damaged item.  
2. **Collaborate on the Repair**: Work alongside our skilled volunteers to fix the item together.  
3. **Learn and Connect**: Ask questions, pick up new skills, and enjoy connecting with others in the community.  
4. **Pay It Forward**: While our services are free, donations are welcome to help support the initiative.  

## Where and When  

The Nelson Repair Café is aiming to host regular events throughout the year at convenient locations in and around Nelson. Stay tuned for our full event schedule and venues.  

## Get Involved  

We’re always looking for:  
- **Volunteers**: Share your repair skills or help organize events.  
- **Donors**: Support us with tools, materials, or financial contributions.  
- **Participants**: Bring your items and spread the word!  

Together, we can make Nelson a hub for sustainability, creativity, and community. Let’s repair the world, one item at a time!
