Welcome to the Nelson Repair Café! Starting in 2025, we are a community-driven initiative based in Nelson, BC, dedicated to reducing waste, sharing skills, and fostering connections. Our mission is to help repair, reuse, and repurpose items that might otherwise end up in the landfill.

Whether it’s a broken appliance, torn clothing, or a cherished item in need of TLC, our team of skilled volunteers is here to help. Together, we can extend the life of your belongings, save resources, and learn a thing or two about fixing things along the way!

Join us at our regular events to repair, connect, and make a positive impact in our community.
